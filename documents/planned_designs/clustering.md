# Objective
Currently Teiserver runs on a single node, we would like to run it on multiple nodes. After performing all these steps Teiserver should be able to run across multiple nodes in a transparent manner without compromising the ability to run it on a single node.

This document serves as a list of steps to convert the game from single to multi node 

## Summary of progress
##### Propagate data
- [X] **Stage 1:** Central module functions
- [X] **Stage 2:** Implement ClusterServer
- [X] **Stage 3:** Cache actions should use the new functions in `Central`

##### PID store
- [X] **Stage 1:** Change each server process to register it's `pid` with `Teiserver.ServerRegistry`.
- [X] **Stage 2:** Ensure on a running server each of the servers expected appears in the registry list
- [X] **Stage 3:** Update all `get_server_pid` functions to call the registry, test them
- [X] **Stage 4:** Remove the ETS table and calls to it

##### PubSub.broadcast
- [X] **Stage 1:** Identify which pubsub messages need to include the sending `Node.self()` as part of their structure
- [X] **Stage 2:** One message at a time, update the documentation and implementation of said message (both send and receive)
- [X] **Stage 3:** Identify counters that need to be a singleton (e.g. lobby_id, spring_id)
- [X] **Stage 4:** Convert these to singletons

##### Less reliance on pre-caching
- [X] **Stage 1:** Identify pre-caches used
- [X] **Stage 2:** Add a `caches.md` documentation file
- [X] **Stage 3:** Decide which can be migrated away
- [X] **Stage 4:** Might need to use cache_update rather than cache_put to help ensure consistency
- [X] **Stage 5:** Migrate caches away

##### Per node processes
- [X] **Stage 1:** List each type of process we track.
- [X] **Stage 2:** Convert these to use a Horde DynamicSupervisor
- [ ] **Stage 3:** Have them all startup from Teiserver.Startup where they can check for existing PIDs
- [ ] **Stage 4:** Scheduled Oban jobs

## Known issues
- ETS (via ConCache) is node specific, we need to make changes propagate across the cluster

## Work items
##### Propagate data
Any time an ETS is updated this needs to be propagated. `Teiserver.cache_put` and `Teiserver.cache_delete` are two functions to help with this.

##### PID store
Various services place their PID into ETS, this should be changed to be a Registry. Long term we might want to swap to a pool system and things being in a Registry will make this easier.

##### PubSub.broadcast
Currently we use `broadcast` but in some cases we might need to either include the node with the data or use `broadcast_local`. One example would be achievements, we don't want to double-count them.

Additionally we should change anything that would normally be send(pid) to instead either be `GenServer.cast` or a `PubSub.broadcast` to make it more explicit.

The initial pass seems to show we only need to tweak a couple of messages needed to have their node of origin included.

##### Less reliance on pre-caching
When taking place pre-caching is an opportunity for nodes to diverge in state (e.g. user list). Ideally this would be replaced by a solution not requiring a pre-cache. As a bonus this will improve startup time.

##### Per node processes
We can't have N processes for every process such as ConsulServer processes, these need to be placed on a single node and communicated with via PubSub. At the same time we do want to have 1 central process per node without overlapping actions, e.g. CoordinatorServer.

We can use Horde to run a process with a single name and have it automatically get pushed over to other nodes when the host node goes down. At the same time we can have a per-node process by not using the Swarm/Horde supervisor. PubSub will work across nodes and so we need to be mindful of it as per the above point.

## List/explanation of steps to take
##### Propagate data
- **Stage 1:** Central module to have a selection of functions for updating the cache, when called locally they should also broadcast to the cluster to perform the same action
- **Stage 2:** Implement a cluster server process which listens to the messages mentioned in Stage 1 and acts on ones from other nodes while discarding from it's own
- **Stage 3:** Aside from one-time build caches, all cache actions should use the new functions in `Central`

##### PID store
- **Stage 1:** Change each server process to register it's `pid` with `Teiserver.ServerRegistry`.
- **Stage 2:** Ensure on a running server each of the servers expected appears in the registry list.
  Use the code snippet `Registry.select(Teiserver.ServerRegistry, [{{:"$1", :"$2", :"$3"}, [], [{{:"$1", :"$2", :"$3"}}]}])`
- **Stage 3:** Update all `get_server_pid` functions to call the registry, test them
- **Stage 4:** Remove the ETS table and calls to it

##### PubSub.broadcast
Note: This ties in with the "Per node process" item.
- **Stage 1:** Identify which pubsub messages need to include the sending `Node.self()` as part of their structure. By default we should assume all items are global.
- **Stage 2:** One message at a time, update the documentation and implementation of said message (both send and receive)
- **Stage 3:** Identify counters that need to be a singleton, they probably need to be placed in a single GenServer instance rather than ETS. Investigation has found two id counters that need to be singletons.
  - User SpringId
  - Lobby match_id
- **Stage 4:** Convert these to singletons

##### Less reliance on pre-caching
- **Stage 1:** Identify pre-caches used
- **Stage 2:** Add a `caches.md` documentation file at [/documents/dev_designs/caches.md](/documents/dev_designs/caches.md) to document the different caches
- **Stage 3:** Decide which can be migrated away
- **Stage 4:** Might need to use cache_update rather than cache_put to help ensure consistency
- **Stage 5:** Migrate the caches away

##### Per node processes
- **Stage 1:** List each type of process we track.
  - List of per ID processes (1 per id in entire cluster):
    - ConsulServer
    - LobbyThrottleServer
    - AccoladeChatServer
    - QueueServer
  - Per cluster processes that might need to be changed to use pooled resources (e.g. worker pool):
    - CoordinatorServer
    - AccoldeBotServer
    - AutomodServer
  - Per cluster processes
    - TelemetryServer
    - AchievementServer
- **Stage 2:** Convert these to use a Horde DynamicSupervisor
- **Stage 3:** Have them all startup from Teiserver.Startup where they can check for existing PIDs
- **Stage 4:** Discover how scheduled Oban jobs will work, some of them are long running and we don't want to duplicate them

## Lessons learned
- Ensure when registering processes they have a unique key. I accidentally registered the LobbyThrottles without having the lobby_id be part of the key and as a result they didn't register correctly at first.
- The pubsub.md document was incredibly helpful in planning, more documents like it should be made
